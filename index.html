    <h1>Demo Page for "TeleMelody: Lyric-to-Melody Generation with a Template-Based Two-Stage Method"</h1>

    <h4 style='display:inline'>Abstract: </h4>
    <p style='display:inline'> Lyric-to-melody generation is an important task in automatic songwriting. Previous
        lyric-to-melody generation systems usually adopt end-to-end models that directly generate melodies from lyrics,
        which suffer from several issues: 1) lack of paired lyric-melody training data; 2) lack of control on generated
        melodies. In this paper, we develop TeleMelody, a two-stage lyric-to-melody generation system with music
        structure information (e.g., tonality, chord, rhythm and cadence) as the bridge between lyric and melody, i.e.,
        the system consists of a lyric-to-template module and a template-to-melody module. TeleMelody has two
        advantages. First, it is data efficient. The template-to-melody module is trained in a self-supervised way
        (i.e., the source template data is extracted from the target melody) that does not need any paired data, and the
        lyric-to-template module is made up of some rule-based modules and a lyric-to-rhythm model trained with paired
        lyric and rhythm, which is easier to obtain than the paired lyric-melody data. Second, it is controllable. The
        designs of template and alignment regularization guided by musical knowledge ensure that the generated melodies
        are under the control of musical elements that can be adjusted at will. Both subjective and objective
        experimental evaluations demonstrate that TeleMelody can generate melody with higher quality, better
        controllability, and less requirement on paired lyric-melody data than previous generation systems. </p>
